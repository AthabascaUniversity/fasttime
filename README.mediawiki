== Deploying ==
To deploy to a local tomcat instance, you really only need to do one thing.
You need to setup a server instance in settings.xml called '''localhost'''.
It is assumed that you are running on http://localhost:8080, and that you have
a tomcat manager installed.

== Api Examples ==
=== Services ===
Initial login, returns login information
http://localhost:8080/fasttime/proxy/?fct=getprojects&guid=123544dd-ee58-4924-9d9b-2bdf01379bb8&format=JSON

Gets the projects based on the text to search on.  Remove that, and it will return all projects you have access to.
http://localhost:8080/fasttime/proxy/?fct=getprojects&guid=123544dd-ee58-4924-9d9b-2bdf01379bb8&format=JSON&texttosearch=ASRP%20Technical%20Finance

Gets the tasks available for a specific project
http://localhost:8080/fasttime/proxy/?fct=gettasks&guid=123544dd-ee58-4924-9d9b-2bdf01379bb8&format=JSON&projectid=2

For creating a week, but I don't think we need this, as they should theoretically already be auto-creating.
http://localhost:8080/fasttime/proxy/?fct=createweek&guid=e0525025-a85a-46f2-97e1-bfd71add5664&dateweekstart=

http://localhost:8080/fasttime/proxy/?fct=getweeks&guid=e0525025-a85a-46f2-97e1-bfd71add5664

It seems that a call to SaveWorkItem is required to create single line as shown in the Ace Web Interface.  However, it would seem that creation of a TimePeriodId may be required first.
http://localhost:8080/fasttime/proxy/?fct=saveworkitem&taskid=647&projectid=48


http://localhost:8080/fasttime/proxy/?fct=createweek&dateweekstart=

http://localhost:8080/fasttime/proxy/proxy/?fct=getweeks&format=json

=== Testing Calls ===
If you need to test a call, just use chrome developers tools in your browser,
firebug in firefox, or some other such developer system that lets you play
with Javascript within your browser.

We've created a test call function, which appends the current guid
automatically so that you can get right to playing with the APIs.  When the
call is made, the guid is appended, and the results are logged automatically.

An example call is as follows...
 testCall('http://localhost:8080/fasttime/proxy/?fct=getweeks&format=json');
